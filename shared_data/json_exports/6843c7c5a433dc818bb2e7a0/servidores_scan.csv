Nessus was able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials. There may have been a protocol failure that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may be invalid. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","N/A","","SMB was detected on port 445 but no credentials were provided.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol.
